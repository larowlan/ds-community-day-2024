## DrupalSouth Community Day 2024
### Venue Sponsor's remarks

Note:

- I would say thanks for inviting me to speak, but as sponsors of the venue, we were given this slot
- So that gives us 20 mins to hit you up with a hard sell
- So please lock the doors, we have a captive audience

---

## What am I selling?

---

## Not a training product

Note: 
- but it will work in the same way - people will get new skills, technical and interpersonal

---

## Not marketing

Note:
- it can make you more attractive to clients, employers, employees
- and it will give you whiter white and brighter brights

---

## Not a social network*

*Technically

Note:
- but it will help you build networks
- you might even make some friends
- and you can earn karma
- certainly a great way to spend your time online, more positive than doomscrolling

---

## What is this product?

---

## üíß Drupal contribution

---

## Building a culture of contribution

Note:
- I've been at previous next for 12 years, nearly 13
- Here at previousnext we're internationally recognised as a major Drupal contributor
- but it hasn't always been this way
- I'm here to share some of the ways we do this
- hopefully you can take some of these ideas back to work with you after the conference

---

## Work out why you want to contribute

Note:
- I mentioned all the benefits at the start
- But lets dive into that in more detail

---

### üí≠ To ensure Drupal's long-term livelihood

Note:
- You've spent a lot of time and effort building your sites on Drupal
- You want to get the most out of that investement
- you have a vested interest
- no one wants to be marooned on dead tech

---

### üí≠ To align Drupal with your strategic goals

Note:
- Drupal is a do-ocracy
- Decisions are made by those who show up
- If you're not taking part in the conversations you may end up somewhere you don't want to be
- getting involved is your chance to have a say in the direction and share your unique needs

---

### üí≠ To grow your staff skillsets

Note:
- drupal has a notorious record of being hard to master
- you get to work with the brightest Drupal minds in the world
- you can learn from their approach and feedback on yours
- eg committee - opportunity to work with people from different backgrounds with fresh perspectives on problems you're trying to solve
- eg code reviews - review code of some of the best drupal devs in the world, or have them review your code

---

### üí≠ To enhance your reputation as an employer of choice

Note:
- Drupal talent can be hard to recruit and retain
- Our average tenure at PNX is 6+ years, this is unheard of
- we've talked about why, let's talk about how

---

## Start small - set a goal

Note:
- What's the best way to get started?
- attend contribution day (online or virtual)
- take part in meetings and discussions
- providing feedback on designs
- manual test things
- Make contribution goals part of your annual employee review processes, talk to your employees about ideas they have and things like to learn
- Friday afternoon contrib

---

## Treat it as an investment

Note:
- for us our marketing and training budgets are largely spent on sponsoring code sprints and speaking at and attending events like this
- lots of small contributions are still effective

---

## Things can take time

Note:
- Drupal is a large and complex project with a reputation for stability, sometimes things can move slowly
- its important not to get disheartened by this
- or try to help someone advance someone else's ideas in exchange for them helping you
- as you build more networks you will find you have greater success by working with your contacts
- sometimes knowing who to ask is half the battle, so even 'lurking' in channels and issues is a worthwhile investment
- find out who's who in the zoo

---

## Get into a regular habit

Note:
- Give your employees time for contribution
- Projects have peaks and troughs, in the peaks make a note of things you would like to work on
- in the troughs come back to those things
- "A website is like a garden, not a house, you need to continually tend to it" and contribution is the same
- i've worked on issues where i recieved credit for a contribution I did seven years after the fact
- if you build it they will come
- we've talked about how and why, let's talk about what

---

## Find your niche

Note:
- Drupal is vast, no one person can know all things
- getting started can be overwhelming

---

## Find your niche

#### üëâÔ∏è Find something you care about

Note:
- it might be accessibility
- it might be performance
- as the mentoring team used to say 'we've got issues'
- the different backgrounds and skillsets of Drupal are what make it so strong

---

## Find your niche

#### üëâÔ∏è Find something no-one cares about.

Note:
- For me it was the forum module
- for my colleauge Mohit it was 'needs tests' issues
- for stephen mustgrave it was the size of the 'needs review' backlog

---

## Find your niche

#### üëâÔ∏è Find something that would make your day job easier

Note:
- software can be frustrating
- we've all had that 'table flip' moment
- the beauty of open source is you are empowered to fix it rather than suffer in silence
- We have fieldable block types in core in Drupal 8 because I was tired of all the different solutions in D7

---

## Find your niche

#### üëâÔ∏è Working with an agency that can guide you

Note:
- ServiceNSW is a major contributor to Drupal
- Their logo has featured in the Driesnote
- They work with us to improve pain points for their site
- and through this everyone has benefited

---

## Swim with the current

Note:
- We have lots of strategic initiatives
- These are things that move faster
- You're more likely to get wins and bang for your buck here
- Drupal CMS (aka starshot) is a great example here
- This has galvanised a new group of contributors and had great velocity
- if you're toiling away in isolation, you lose a lot of the benefits

---

## Release your custom code

Note:
- Sparks interactive boldly decided 'no custom code'
- This isn't for everyone
- But if you have a useful module, and release it, the cost of ownership is reduced
- Entity hierarchy is a great example - we wrote it for UTS who used node hierarchy in D7 and found it caused major issues with revisions and data corruption
- When we moved to D8 we wrote entity hierarchy as a from the ground rewrite
- They were happy to release it
- Now it is getting fixes and improvements from Universities and Governement agencies across the country.
- CDU added support for microsites
- DCS rewrote it to be more performant
- UTS needed microsites and because they had open sourced it, the feature already existed
  - How many pieces of amazing custom code are locked up somewhere in a private repository never to see the light of day, never to meet their full potential

## Be sloppy sam

https://webchick.net/embrace-the-chaos

Note:
- this is a must read
- the tl;dr is two devs, one slaves away in isolation 'perfectionist pat' 
- the other works with the community 'sloppy sam' - puts up their WIP
- others improved it while they sleep 'code fairies in the night'
- by the time pat has gotten the courage to share their work, sam and the community have already fixed it
- don't be scared of being wrong, bring an open mind

---

## Celebrate the wins

Note:
- When someone in your team is involved in something celebrate it
- This can be as simple as a #shoutouts channel in slack or teams
- If you have socials, call it out there too

---

## Share your success

Note:
- How many agencies here know about the Drupal Planet aggregator
- How many agencies are in that feed?
- Write about what you do (Blog posts)
- Talk at events like this
- Share it with the wider community
- Give people a forum to respond (slack threads/social media)

---

### Questions‚ùìÔ∏è

- üó®Ô∏è larowlan #australia-nz / drupal.slack.org
- Chat with me in the hall

Note:
- I'm happy to help folks get started
- Willing to talk to groups about it
- I wear a lot of hats in the community but I see enabling others as one of the most valuable ways to spend my time
